Driving SSD1306 OLED screens

Python module for driving such OLED screens can be pulled from MicroPython's Git repo:

wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/micropython/micropython/master/drivers/display/ssd1306.py
ampy -p /dev/ttyUSB0 put ssd1306.py

Random ESP32 based board with a screen from AliExpress used I2C interface but the chip also supports SPI interace. In this case the I2C interace is bit banged on pins 4 and 5.

To paste chunks of indented text like the one below press Ctrl-E, paste the text as usual by right clicking in the terminal and selecting Paste. Once finished press Ctrl-D to tell Python interpreter that you're done.

from time import sleep_ms
from machine import Pin, I2C
from ssd1306 import SSD1306_I2C

i2c = I2C(-1, Pin(4),Pin(5),freq=400000) # Bitbanged I2C bus
assert 60 in i2c.scan(), "No OLED display detected!"
oled = SSD1306_I2C(128, 64, i2c)
buf = "wubba lubba dub dub  "
oled.invert(0) # White text on black background
oled.contrast(255) # Maximum contrast
j = 0

while True:
    oled.fill(0)

    oled.text(buf[j%len(buf):]+buf, 10, 10)
    oled.show()
    sleep_ms(20)
    j += 1
    
And it works!
